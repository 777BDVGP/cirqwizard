cirQWizard - Gerber to GCode converter and much more
==========

cirQWizard is a cross-platform open source software designed to control PCB prototyping machines. It’s much more than Gerber to GCode converter – it generates GCode, controls the machine and guides a user through the processes of:

* insulation milling
* holes drilling
* contour milling
* solder paste dispensing
* SMD components placement

Compatible machines
===================
As it is, it’s perfectly matched to work with [Cirqoid](http://cirqoid.com) machines. But, being open source and having modular architecture, can be adapted to any machine of your choice. Downloadable binaries for Mac OS X, Linux and Windows! Supports all EDAs capable of exporting Gerber and Excellon files.
